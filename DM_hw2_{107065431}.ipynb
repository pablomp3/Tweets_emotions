Unfortunately, time was not enough to keep on exploring further options. I have talked to other classmates and the key could be in a good **cleaning** of the data and **feature engineering**, so I think I could have explored this option more, besided of course, trying new **CNN models**.\n",

    "I also think that the 6h of **Kaggle** may be a limitation, although I am not sure about the quantity of features usually selected in other data mining projects that obtain much higher accuracy levels (around 70%).\n",
